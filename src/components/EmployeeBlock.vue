          <p>Finding the right employee insurance can feel like a stalemate game of chess.</p>

          <p>
            Now more than ever, key employees are scrutinizing employee benefit programs and prioritizing organizations that are forward thinking, with rich benefit plans and perks at the top of their lists.
          </p>

          <p>
          A recent survey by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants concluded that 80% of those surveyed would choose a job with benefits, even if an identical job was offered with a 30% greater salary with no benefits. 
          </p>

          <p>
          The job market is oversaturated, and finding the right employees can make or break your company.
